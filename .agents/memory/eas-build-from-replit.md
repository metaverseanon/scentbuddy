# Triggering EAS Build / Submit from Replit

Run `eas` from the Expo artifact dir (`artifacts/scentbuddy`, where `eas.json` + `app.json` live). `eas` is installed globally.

## Must set EAS_NO_VCS=1
The main agent blocks destructive git operations, so `eas build` fails with
`Destructive git operations are not allowed ... .git/index.lock` because EAS uses git to archive the project.
**Fix:** prefix with `EAS_NO_VCS=1`, which makes EAS tar the working directory (respecting .gitignore/.easignore) instead of using git.

**Why:** EAS's default VCS archiver writes to `.git`; that write is sandbox-blocked here.
**How to apply:** any `eas build` (and anything that archives the project) from the main agent → `EAS_NO_VCS=1 eas build ...`.

## Non-interactive flags
The bash runner can't answer prompts, so always pass `--non-interactive`. Use `--no-wait` so the call returns after the build is queued (EAS builds take ~20-40 min; far longer than the 2-min command cap). Monitor with `eas build:view <id>` / `eas build:list`.

## Login
Interactive `eas login` (password/2FA) must be done by the user in the **Shell tab** — the agent bash can't type into prompts. The session persists in `~/.expo/state.json`, which the agent's bash shares (same container/home), so after the user logs in the agent can run `eas whoami` and proceed.

## TestFlight (iOS) one-shot
`EAS_NO_VCS=1 eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit --non-interactive --no-wait`
- `production` profile: store distribution, `autoIncrement` build number, channel `production`.
- `--auto-submit` queues the App Store Connect submission server-side after the build (uses `submit.production.ios.ascAppId` in eas.json).
- Apple signing creds (dist cert + provisioning profile) and the ASC API key are stored on EAS servers for this project, so build+submit run fully non-interactively — no Apple login needed.
